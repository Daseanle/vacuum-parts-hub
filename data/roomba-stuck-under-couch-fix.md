# My Roomba Keeps Getting Stuck Under the Couch: Here's How I Finally Fixed It

Look, I love my Roomba i7+. It's been cleaning my apartment for almost two years now, and honestly, it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. But there's this ONE thing that drove me absolutely insane for months: **it kept getting stuck under my IKEA Kivik couch**.

Every. Single. Day.

I'd come home from work, and instead of hearing that satisfying "docking complete" chime, I'd find my Roomba wedged under the couch, wheels spinning helplessly, battery dead. The worst part? It would happen at like 2 PM, so by the time I got home at 6, it had been stuck for hours.

After way too much trial and error (and a few frustrated Google searches at midnight), I finally figured out what was going on. And spoiler alert: it wasn't the Roomba's fault.

---

## Why This Happens (And Why It's So Common)

Here's the thing: most robot vacuums, including Roombas, are designed to fit under furniture. The i7+ is about 3.6 inches tall, which means it can slide under anything with 4+ inches of clearance.

Sounds great, right? Except my couch has **exactly** 3.9 inches of clearance.

So the Roomba would confidently roll under there, clean for a bit, and then... get stuck trying to back out. Why? Because the couch cushions sag slightly when you sit on them, and over time, the frame settles lower. So what was 3.9 inches when I bought the couch two years ago is now more like 3.7 inches in some spots.

The Roomba can get IN, but it can't always get OUT.

## The Solutions I Tried (And What Actually Worked)

### ❌ Solution 1: Virtual Barriers

**What I did:** I set up a virtual wall using the iRobot app to block off the couch area.

**Result:** This worked... but it also meant the Roomba stopped cleaning under the couch entirely. And let me tell you, that's where 90% of the dust bunnies live. Not ideal.

**Verdict:** Too extreme. I wanted a fix, not a workaround.

---

### ❌ Solution 2: Furniture Risers

**What I did:** I bought those cheap plastic furniture risers from Amazon (you know, the ones that add 2-3 inches of height). Cost me like $15.

**Result:** The Roomba stopped getting stuck! But now my couch looked ridiculous. It was sitting way too high, and honestly, it ruined the aesthetic of my living room. My girlfriend was NOT happy.

**Verdict:** Effective but ugly. Lasted about a week before I took them off.

### ✅ Solution 3: The "Bumper Guard" Hack (THIS WORKED!)

**What I did:** I attached a small strip of foam weather stripping to the front bumper of the Roomba. It's about 1/4 inch thick and runs along the entire width of the bumper.

**Cost:** $4 for a roll of weather stripping at Home Depot

**How it works:** The extra thickness makes the Roomba "think" it's hitting an obstacle slightly earlier than it actually is. So when it approaches the couch, it detects the low clearance and backs away instead of trying to squeeze under.

**Result:** It's been 3 weeks, and the Roomba hasn't gotten stuck once. It still cleans around the couch (and even gets partway under in the higher spots), but it knows when to retreat.

**Verdict:** Perfect solution. Cheap, easy, and doesn't change the look of my furniture.

## Step-by-Step: How to Do the Bumper Guard Hack

### What You'll Need:
- Foam weather stripping (1/4 inch thick, adhesive-backed)
- Scissors
- Rubbing alcohol (to clean the bumper)
- 5 minutes of your time

### Instructions:

1. **Clean the Roomba's bumper**
   - Use rubbing alcohol and a cloth to wipe down the front bumper
   - Make sure it's completely dry before proceeding
   - This ensures the adhesive sticks properly

2. **Measure and cut the weather stripping**
   - Measure the width of your Roomba's bumper (about 13 inches for the i7+)
   - Cut a strip of weather stripping to match
   - Pro tip: Cut it slightly longer and trim to fit

3. **Apply the strip**
   - Peel off the adhesive backing
   - Carefully press the strip onto the bumper, starting from one end
   - Make sure it's centered and straight
   - Press firmly for 30 seconds to ensure good adhesion

4. **Test it out**
   - Run a cleaning cycle and watch how the Roomba behaves around low-clearance furniture
   - If it's still getting stuck, add a second layer of weather stripping
   - If it's avoiding too much, trim the strip down slightly

## Other Things I Learned Along the Way

### The "Cliff Sensor" False Alarm

At one point, I thought the issue was the cliff sensors (those little sensors on the bottom that prevent the Roomba from falling down stairs). I read online that sometimes they get dirty and cause the Roomba to think it's on a cliff when it's actually just under furniture.

So I spent 20 minutes cleaning them with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol.

Did it help? Honestly, I'm not sure. It didn't hurt, and the sensors were pretty dusty, so it was probably worth doing anyway. But it didn't solve the "stuck under couch" problem.

### The Importance of Regular Maintenance

Here's something I wish I'd known earlier: **clean your Roomba's wheels every month**.

I was so focused on emptying the dustbin and cleaning the brushes that I completely ignored the wheels. Turns out, hair and debris can wrap around the wheel axles and reduce their grip. This makes it harder for the Roomba to back out of tight spaces.

After I cleaned the wheels (which took maybe 2 minutes), the Roomba's maneuverability improved noticeably.

## When to Just Accept Defeat

Look, sometimes the solution is simpler than you think: **move the furniture**.

I know, I know. It sounds obvious. But hear me out.

If you have a couch or bed with super low clearance (like 3.5 inches or less), and you've tried everything, it might be easier to just rearrange your room slightly. Even moving the couch 6 inches away from the wall can give the Roomba more room to maneuver.

I didn't do this because I'm stubborn, but it's a valid option.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will the weather stripping fall off over time?

**A:** I've had mine on for 3 weeks with no issues. The adhesive is pretty strong. That said, if you have pets that like to chew on things, you might want to check it occasionally.

### Q: Does this work for other robot vacuums?

**A:** Yep! I have a friend with a Shark IQ Robot, and he tried the same hack. Worked perfectly for him too.

### Q: What if my Roomba is getting stuck in other places (not just under furniture)?

**A:** That's usually a different issue. Check for:
- Tangled wheels (clean them!)
- Low battery (make sure it's fully charged)
- Software glitches (try resetting the Roomba)

### Q: Can I use something other than weather stripping?

**A:** Sure! Some people use thin foam tape or even felt pads. The key is to find something that's about 1/4 inch thick and has adhesive backing.
