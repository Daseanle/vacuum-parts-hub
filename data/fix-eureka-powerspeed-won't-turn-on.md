Is your Eureka PowerSpeed experiencing won't turn on? This is a common issue that can usually be resolved with some simple troubleshooting steps.

## Quick Diagnosis

Before diving into repairs, let's identify the root cause:

1. **Check the basics**: Is it plugged in? Is the battery charged?
2. **Inspect for blockages**: Remove the dustbin and check for clogs
3. **Examine the filter**: A dirty filter can cause many issues
4. **Look for damage**: Check hoses and connections for cracks

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Solution 1: Clean the Filter
A clogged filter is the #1 cause of won't turn on in Eureka vacuums.

**Steps:**
1. Remove the filter (usually located near the dustbin)
2. Tap out loose debris
3. Rinse under cold water (if washable)
4. Let dry completely (24 hours)
5. Reinstall

### Solution 2: Check for Blockages
Blockages in the hose or brush roll can trigger won't turn on.

**Steps:**
1. Detach the hose from the main unit
2. Use a broomstick to push out any clogs
3. Remove the brush roll and clear any hair/debris
4. Reassemble and test

### Solution 3: Replace Worn Parts
If cleaning doesn't help, you may need replacement parts.

**Common culprits:**
- Worn belt (if brush won't spin)
- Dead battery (if won't turn on)
- Damaged motor (if making strange noises)
